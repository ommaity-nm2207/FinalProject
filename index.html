                I understand, but it's important to communicate your feelings. Maybe they're feeling the same way.
            </div>
            <div class="message parker">
                Maybe. But what if we just don't have anything in common anymore?

            <div class="message stark">
                That's possible, but it's also possible to have different interests and still maintain a friendship. It just takes effort and compromise.

                I know, but it just feels like we're on different paths now.

                I understand how you feel. But remember, friendships change and evolve over time. It's normal to drift apart from people.

            <div class="message parker">
                I guess so. It's just hard because we've been friends for so long.

            <div class="message stark">
                I know, sweetie. But you'll always have the memories and experiences you shared together. And who knows, maybe in the future you'll find that you have more in common again.

            <div class="message parker">
                Yeah, you're right. Thanks for listening, mom.

                Anytime, honey. And remember, I'm here for you if you need to talk.
